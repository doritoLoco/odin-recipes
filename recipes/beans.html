        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a favorite at potlucks! I've often wondered if I get invited for my company or my Cola Beans! I've tried several different brands of colas, but have found that Coke® works best. I like to pre-cook the bacon about half-way so it doesn't make the beans too greasy, but it's not necessary. This recipe can also be baked in a conventional oven at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (28 ounce) cans baked beans, drained</li>
            <li>½ pound bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can cola soft drink (such as Coke®)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a slow cooker, alternately layer the baked beans, bacon, and brown sugar. Pour in some of the cola with each layer, until all has been used.</li>
            <li>Cover, and cook 8 to 10 hours on Low or 4 to 6 hours on High. (See Cook's Note for oven directions.)</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
