# odin-recipes
In this project, I am going to use everything I have learned with the HTML foundations and I am going to create a basic recipe website that is going to have a main page with recipe names and when you click on those names it is going to link to another page on that website.
This project is going to involve the practice of linking to other pages on the same website, using ordered and unordered lists, and will have images relating to the recipe.
